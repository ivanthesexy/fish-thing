## running

you can download the precompiled version in releases

requires nothing and work on all desktop operating systems since they are all self-contained
meaning the file contains everything it needs inside of it so no need to install anything

## building

requires .net 6.0 sdk and git

first, download the source code (etiher with git or zip would work)

open your terminal app or cmd and navigate to the folder (using `cd` followed by the path of the folder)

run `dotnet build` to build it

you can also build and run it with `dotnet run`

after the build, the program should be in somewhere in the `bin\net6.0` folder.
